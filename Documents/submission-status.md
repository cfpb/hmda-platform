## Submission status

Every submission will store a `SubmissionStatus` object with the following structure:

* `code`: `Integer`
* `message`: `String`

In order to track the status of a filing for a financial institution, the following states are captured by the backend:

* `1`: `Created`. The filing has been created and is ready to accept data
* `2`: `Uploading`. Data is currently being uploaded to the system
* `3`: `Uploaded`. Data has finished uploading, is stored in the `HMDA Platform` and is ready to be checked
* `4`: `Parsing`. The submitted information is being checked for parsing errors according to the [HMDA File Specification](2017_File_Spec_LAR.csv).
* `5`: `Parsed`. Filed data is conformant and is ready to be validated by the rule engine
* `6`: `ParsedWithErrors`. Filed data is incorrectly formatted, requires resubmission.
* `7`: `Validating`. Submitted data is being run through the validation engine that checks for [Edit Checks]()
* `8`: `ValidatedWithErrors`. There are validation errors in the provided information. Depending on the type of error (syntactical and / or validity) a new submission might be necessary
* `9`: `Validated`. Information submitted is valid and can be `Signed`
* `10`: `IRSGenerated`. The IRS report has been generated
* `11`: `IRSVerified`. The IRS report has been verified by the financial institution.
* `12`: `Signed`. The financial institution has certified that the data is correct. This finishes the HMDA filing process
* `-1`: `Failed`. An error occurred in the process of submitting data, the submission needs to be performed again
