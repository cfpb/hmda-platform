## Authorization
Each endpoint that starts with `/institutions` is protected by three authorization requirements.

* Requests must include the `CFPB-HMDA-Username` header.
  * Its value should be the username of the user making the request.
* Requests must include the `CFPB-HMDA-Institutions` header.
  * This header will contain the comma-separated list of institution IDs
    that the user is authorized to view.
* For requests to institution-specific paths, such as `/institutions/<institution>`
  and `/institutions/<institution>/summary` (any endpoint except `/institutions`),
  the institution ID requested must match one of the IDs in the `CFPB-HMDA-Institutions`
  header.
